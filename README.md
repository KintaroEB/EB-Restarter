# EB-Restarter
Simple Restarter for ExileBot - in case you experience idle states after some time running

HOW TO USE:
- place it directly into the EB folder
- make sure restarter.exe and cports.exe have administrative rights
- you must have the EB setup finalized for botting
- F2 EXIT
- F3 PAUSE/UNPAUSE

HOW IT WORKS:
- checking for idle state -> if time exceeds 60 seconds -> logout POE to loginscreen -> close EB -> start EB -> start botting
- check the ini file for a couple of configurable values!
